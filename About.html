                    Many fish live in a large pond. Of all these Pisces, three are best friends who are always together.
                    They never separate from each other.

                    One day a fisherman comes to this pond. Seeing much fish, he invites other fishermen to drop their
                    nets. The three fish are afraid of being caught and killed by the fishermen.

                    The wise fish among them says, “We must find another pond and get out of here quickly.” While one
                    fish agrees, the other hesitates, feeling that this pond is his home. He says: “We must not act
                    cowardly, this pond is our home.”

                    The other two fish try so hard to convince their friend but fail. So they decide to split up and go
                    in search of a new pond. The next day when the fishermen arrive, the fish that did not want to leave
                    is caught and dies.
